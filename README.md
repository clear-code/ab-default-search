ab-default-search
=================

Provides ability to set default search query for address books.

If you use an LDAP addressbook, you have to do any search to see the list of addresses in the book. This addon automatically searches addressbooks with a letter `@` so you don't have to do search to see addresses in LDAP addressbooks.

The default query is configurable. Go to "Config Editor" (aka "about:config") and change the value of `extensions.ab-default-search@clear-code.com.query` as you like.
